# rpizwh-am2302

In this project, we will setup 3 Raspberry PI Zero HW with AM2302 temperature and humidity sensor. The goal is to place at strategic places in my apartment each of the 3 Raspberry PI, to measure every 30 seconds a new value in order to see the evolution of the temperature and humidity over time.
